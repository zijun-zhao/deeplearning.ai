----------
1. 'continue' not properly in loop in **Python**

**continue is only allowed within a for or while loop**.

2. Remove an element from list in **Python**
```Python
T_list =  = ['no surfing', 'flippers']
T_list.remove('no surfing')
```

3. Remove certain elements from numpy.array in **Python**
```Python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
b = np.array([3,4,7])
c = np.setdiff1d(a,b)
```
